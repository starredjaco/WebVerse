story: |
  OrbitDesk is a premium client portal and project hub used by boutique consultancies to share documents, coordinate workstreams, and automate customer onboarding.

  The company recently rolled out a new identity service and a next-gen GraphQL API powering the portal. A separate internal ops console helps engineers validate integrations and run diagnostics when customers report issues.

  You have been asked to assess how an external attacker could chain small weaknesses across these surfaces into a real incident, while keeping the experience realistic: lots of normal features, believable copy, and multiple dead ends that feel like a true web assessment.
