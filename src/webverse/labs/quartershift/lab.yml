story: |
  Quarter Shift runs a retro-styled online casino experience with browser games, weekly tournaments, and a public leaderboard.
  The company recently rolled out kiosk clients for on-prem promo events, plus a new moderator program for tournament operations.

  They want a full adversarial verification of the platform’s public properties, the tournament API layer, and any “internal-only”
  backoffice tooling that might be reachable through unexpected paths.
