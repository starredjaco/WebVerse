  Sourcemap leak reveals a legacy ops bridge and hidden fixtures. Use exposed partner invite codes to get a privileged account,
  then pivot through URL-import SSRF to reach a localhost-only ops endpoint. From there, recover an internal files token,
  generate the executive reconciliation export, and grab the flag.
story: |
  HarborLedger is the reconciliation platform used by a shipping conglomerate and its partners to settle invoices, credits, and proof-of-delivery disputes.
  
  Partner support has been flooded with complaints about “phantom adjustments” and inconsistent account views. Leadership believes the issue isn’t just a bug—there may be a security flaw in the workflow. Your mission is to reproduce the exposure, identify what can be accessed, and confirm whether sensitive financial artifacts can be pulled from the system.
