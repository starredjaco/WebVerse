# WebVerse

WebVerse is a local **web & API security lab runner**: a desktop app that discovers labs in `./labs/`, starts them with **Docker Compose**, opens them in your browser, and tracks your progress — all on your own machine.

> **Educational use only.** Labs are intentionally vulnerable. Do **not** expose them to the internet.

## Why WebVerse?

Most practice environments are either:
- too heavy to set up,
- too scattered across repos,
- or too “manual” to run repeatedly.

WebVerse is built to make local practice **repeatable**:
- labs are self-contained
- starting/resetting takes one click
- you can iterate quickly, break things, reset, and try again
